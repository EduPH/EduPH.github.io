title: Towards a philological metric through a topological data analysis approach
---

Let us describe the idea and results behind the paper that can be find in arXiv entitled [Towards a Philological Metric Through a Topological Data Analysis Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09253). To do so, first we need to know some basics and context of the literature of the epoch and the authors we want to study. Specifically, three poets of the golden age were studied: [Lope de Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lope_de_Vega), [Francisco de Quevedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Quevedo), and [Luis de Góngora y Argote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_de_G%C3%B3ngora). 

### The main characters

## Lope de Vega

## Francisco de Quevedo

## Luis de Góngora


## Sonnets

### So...what?


### The take home message

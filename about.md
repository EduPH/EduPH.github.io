Hey there! I am Eduardo. I do research in Mathematics, specifically bridging
Artificial Neural Networks with Computational Topology.

This blog aims to make my research more accessible. However, I might
not tie myself to just the information in papers, but writing about
any topic I find interesting (and that I feel like writing about).

English is not my mother tongue... I do my best but I hope you
understand that there may (I am sure there will) be lots of
mistakes. Be gentle (and patient :))

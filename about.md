Hey there! I am Eduardo, and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of
Seville, Spain. I do research in Mathematics, specifically bridging
Artificial Neural Networks with Computational Topology.

This blog aims to make my research more accessible. However, I might
not tie myself to just the information in papers, but writing about
any topic I find interesting (and that I feel like writing about).

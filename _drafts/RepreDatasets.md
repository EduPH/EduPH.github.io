title: Representative Datasets for Neural Networks
---


Data is the main motivation of all machine learning technic. We deal with data in order to find correlations and infer properties from this data. In this post, I would like to introduce the notion of representative dataset. It was firstly proposed in the paper: ["Representative datasets for neural networks"](http://congreso.us.es/dmd2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DMD2018_paper_19.pdf), and lately, a deeper approximation was done for the specific case of perceptrons in  ["Representative Datasets: The Perceptron Case"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08519). As in the previous post, I do not pretend to do a deep explanation of these papers, just an informal taste of it.
